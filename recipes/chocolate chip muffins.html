    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Make these easy chocolate chip muffins with kids over the weekend or school holidays. They take just 15 minutes prep and are a guaranteed family favourite</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>250g self-raising flour</li>
        <li>150g chocolate chips</li>
        <li>100g sugar</li>
        <li>2 eggs, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>150ml yogurt</li>
        <li>100g unsalted butter, melted</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6 and line a 12-hole muffin tin with paper cases. Sift the flour and bicarbonate of soda into a large bowl, then stir in the chocolate chips and sugar. Add the beaten eggs, yogurt and butter, and stir to combine. It doesn’t matter if the mixture looks a bit lumpy, it’s more important not to overmix or the muffins will turn out tough.</li>
        <li>Fill the paper cases and bake for 20-25 mins until risen and golden brown. Transfer to a rack to cool – or eat slightly warm. Will keep for three days in an airtight container.</li>
    </ol>
